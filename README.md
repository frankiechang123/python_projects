### Pic-to-Ascii-Art-Converter
A cmd app that convert a picture into a txt file with Ascii characters

A starter's project practicing use of Argparse and Pillow

Based on tutorial: https://www.shiyanlou.com/courses/370. The tutorial is not that concise and effective. I personally recommend self-learning Argparse and Pillow.

The Help message in cmd is as following:
```
usage: parsertest.py [-h] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT]
                     [--OutputName OUTPUTNAME]
                     file

convert a picture into a ascii char text

positional arguments:
  file                  the name of the file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --width WIDTH         set width, default=100 pixels
  --height HEIGHT       set height, default=50 pixels
  --OutputName OUTPUTNAME
                        the output txt name
```
